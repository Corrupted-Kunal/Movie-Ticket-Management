# Movie-Ticket-Management
I have developed a streamlined Movie Ticket Management System using Java. This system efficiently handles various functions such as ticket booking, cancellation, and viewing available shows


This Java console application facilitates the booking of movie tickets. The main features include:

- User Information:
Prompts the user to enter their name upon starting the application.

- Main Menu Options:

- Book a Ticket:
The user selects a movie from four available options.
The user then selects a theater from three options.
Finally, the user selects a screen number.
Displays the booking details upon successful selection.

- Cancel a Ticket:
Cancels the booking if a ticket is already booked, resetting the booking details.

- View List of Movies:
Displays the list of available movies.

- View Booked Movies:
Displays details of the booked movie, theater, and screen number if a ticket is booked.
Informs the user if no ticket is booked.

- Exit:
Exits the application.

-Error Handling:
Provides error messages for invalid choices and resets the booking process if necessary.
The program uses simple input and output operations to interact with the user and manage the booking details.
